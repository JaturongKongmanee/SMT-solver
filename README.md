# SMT-solver
Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) problem is a decision problem for logical first order formulas with respect to combinations of background theories such as: arithmetic, bit-vectors, arrays, and uninterpreted functions. In this repository, I will learn Z3, an efficient SMT Solver from Microsoft Research, to apply it in software verification and analysis applications.
